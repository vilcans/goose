description: "Share a Goose session setup (including tools, goals, and instructions) as a reusable recipe that others can launch with a single click"
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Sometimes you finish a task in Goose and realize, "Hey, this setup could be useful again." Maybe you have curated a great combination of tools, defined a clear goal, and want to preserve that flow. Or maybe you're trying to help someone else replicate what you just did without walking them through it step by step. 

You can turn your current Goose session into a reusable recipe that includes the tools, goals, and setup you're using right now and package it into a new Agent that others (or future you) can launch with a single click.

## Create Recipe

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>

   1. While in the session you want to save as a recipe, click the gear icon `⚙️` in the top right corner  
   2. Select **Make recipe from this session**
   3. In the dialog that appears:
      - Provide a **title** for the recipe
      - Provide a **description**
      - A set of **instructions** will also be automatically generated. Review and edit as needed.
      - Provide an optional initial **prompt** to display in the chat box.
      - Some **activities** will be automatically generated. Add or remove as needed. 
   4. Copy the recipe URL and use it however you like (e.g., share it with teammates, drop it in documentation, or keep it for yourself)

   :::warning
   You cannot create a recipe from an existing recipe session, but you can view or [edit the recipe](#edit-recipe).
   :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
   Recipe files can be either JSON (.json) or YAML (.yaml) files. While in a [session](/docs/guides/managing-goose-sessions#start-session), run this command to generate a recipe.yaml file in your current directory:

   ```sh
   /recipe
   ```

   If you want to specify a different name, you can provide it as an argument:

   ```sh
   /recipe my-custom-recipe.yaml
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>recipe file structure</summary>

   ```yaml
   # Required fields
   version: 1.0.0
   title: $title
   description: $description
   instructions: $instructions    # Define the model's behavior

   # Optional fields
   prompt: $prompt                # Initial message to start with

   :::tip Validate Your Recipe
   You should [validate your recipe](#validate-recipe) to verify that it's complete and properly formatted.
   :::

   #### Optional Parameters

   You may add parameters to a recipe, which will require users to fill in data when running the recipe. Parameters can be added to any part of the recipe (instructions, prompt, activities, etc).

   To use parameters:
   1. Add template variables using `{{ variable_name }}` syntax in your recipe content
   2. Define each parameter in the `parameters` section of your YAML file

   <details>
   <summary>Example recipe with parameters</summary>

   ```yaml
   version: 1.0.0
   title: "{{ project_name }} Code Review" # Wrap the value in quotes if it starts with template syntax to avoid YAML parsing errors
   description: Automated code review for {{ project_name }} with {{ language }} focus
   instructions: You are a code reviewer specialized in {{ language }} development.
   prompt: |
      Apply the following standards:
      - Complexity threshold: {{ complexity_threshold }}

  <TabItem value="generator" label="Recipe Generator">
    Use the online [Recipe Generator](https://block.github.io/goose/recipe-generator) tool to create a recipe. First choose your preferred format:

    - **URL Format**: Generates a shareable link that opens a session in the Goose Desktop app
    - **YAML Format**: Generates YAML content that you can save to file and then run in the Goose CLI app

    Then fill out the recipe form by providing:
      - A **title** for the recipe
      - A **description**
      - A set of **instructions** for the recipe.
      - An optional initial **prompt**:
        - In the Desktop app, the prompt displays in the chat box.
        - In the CLI app, the prompt provides the initial message to run. Note that a prompt is required to run the recipe in headless (non-interactive) mode.
      - A set of optional **activities** to display in the Desktop app.
      - YAML format only: Optional **author** contact information and **extensions** the recipe uses.

  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">

  Using a recipe with the Goose CLI might involve the following tasks:
  - [Configuring your recipe location](#configure-recipe-location)
  - [Running a recipe](#run-a-recipe)
  - [Scheduling a recipe](#schedule-a-recipe)

   #### Configure Recipe Location

  Recipes can be stored locally on your device or in a GitHub repository. Configure your recipe repository using either the `goose configure` command or [config file](/docs/guides/config-file#global-settings).

  :::tip Repository Structure
  - Each recipe should be in its own directory
  - Directory name matches the recipe name you use in commands
  - Recipe file can be either recipe.yaml or recipe.json
  :::

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="configure" label="Using goose configure" default>

       Run the configure command:
       ```sh
       goose configure
       ```

       You'll see the following prompts:

       ```sh
       ┌  goose-configure 
       │
       ◆  What would you like to configure?
       │  ○ Configure Providers 
       │  ○ Add Extension 
       │  ○ Toggle Extensions 
       │  ○ Remove Extension 
       // highlight-start
       │  ● Goose Settings (Set the Goose Mode, Tool Output, Tool Permissions, Experiment, Goose recipe github repo and more)
       // highlight-end
       │
       ◇  What would you like to configure?
       │  Goose Settings 
       │
       ◆  What setting would you like to configure?
       │  ○ Goose Mode 
       │  ○ Tool Permission 
       │  ○ Tool Output 
       │  ○ Toggle Experiment 
       // highlight-start
       │  ● Goose recipe github repo (Goose will pull recipes from this repo if not found locally.)
       // highlight-end
       └  
       ┌  goose-configure 
       │
       ◇  What would you like to configure?
       │  Goose Settings 
       │
       ◇  What setting would you like to configure?
       │  Goose recipe github repo 
       │
       ◆  Enter your Goose Recipe GitHub repo (owner/repo): eg: my_org/goose-recipes
       // highlight-start
       │  squareup/goose-recipes (default)
       // highlight-end
       └  
       ```

     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="config" label="Using config file">

       Add to your config file:
       ```yaml title="~/.config/goose/config.yaml"
       GOOSE_RECIPE_GITHUB_REPO: "owner/repo"
       ```

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   #### Run a Recipe

   <Tabs groupId="interface">
     <TabItem value="local" label="Local Recipe" default>

       **Basic Usage** - Run once and exit (see [run options](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) and [recipe commands](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for more):
       ```sh
       # Using recipe file in current directory
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml

       # Using full path
       goose run --recipe ./recipes/my-recipe.yaml
       ```

       **Preview Recipe** - Use the [`explain`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) command to view details before running:
 
       **Interactive Mode** - Start an interactive session:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml --interactive
       ```
       The interactive mode will prompt for required values:
       ```sh
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'language':
       │ Python
       │
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'style_guide':
       │ PEP8
       ```

       **With Parameters** - Supply parameter values when running recipes. See the [`run` command documentation](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) for detailed examples and options.

       Basic example:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml --params language=Python
       ```

     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub Recipe">

       Once you've configured your GitHub repository, you can run recipes by name:

       **Basic Usage** - Run recipes from your configured repo using the recipe name that matches its directory (see [run options](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) and [recipe commands](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for more):

       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe-name
       ```

       For example, if your repository structure is:
       ```
       my-repo/
       ├── code-review/
       │   └── recipe.yaml
       └── setup-project/
           └── recipe.yaml
       ```
       
       You would run the following command to run the code review recipe:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe code-review
       ```

      **Preview Recipe** - Use the [`explain`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) command to view details before running:

       **Interactive Mode** - With parameter prompts:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe code-review --interactive
       ```
       The interactive mode will prompt for required values:
       ```sh
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'project_name':
       │ MyProject
       │
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'language':
       │ Python
       ```

       **With Parameters** - Supply parameter values when running recipes. See the [`run` command documentation](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) for detailed examples and options.

  :::

  #### Schedule a Recipe
  Automate Goose recipes by running them on a schedule.

  **Create a schedule** - Create a scheduled cron job that runs the recipe on the specified cadence. 

  ```bash
  # Add a new scheduled recipe which runs every day at 9 AM
  goose schedule add --id daily-report --cron "0 0 9 * * *" --recipe-source ./recipes/daily-report.yaml
  ```
  The [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression) follows the format "seconds minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week".

  See the [`schedule` command documentation](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#schedule) for detailed examples and options.

## Validate Recipe

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    Recipe validation is only available through the CLI.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Validate your recipe file to ensure it's properly configured. Validation verifies that:
    - All required fields are present
    - Parameters are properly formatted
    - Referenced extensions exist and are valid
    - The YAML/JSON syntax is correct

   ```sh
   goose recipe validate recipe.yaml
   ```

   :::info
   If you want to validate a recipe you just created, you need to [exit the session](/docs/guides/managing-goose-sessions#exit-session) before running the [`validate` subcommand](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe).
   :::

   Recipe validation can be useful for:
    - Troubleshooting recipes that aren't working as expected
    - Verifying recipes after manual edits
    - Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Share Recipe

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    Share your recipe with Desktop users by copying the recipe URL from the recipe creation dialog. When someone clicks the URL, it will open Goose Desktop with your recipe configuration.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Share your recipe with CLI users by directly sending them the recipe file or converting it to a shareable [deep link](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for Desktop users:

    ```sh
    goose recipe deeplink recipe.yaml
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Core Components

 A recipe needs these core components:

   - **Instructions**: Define the agent's behavior and capabilities
      - Acts as the agent's mission statement
      - Makes the agent ready for any relevant task
      - Required if no prompt is provided

   - **Prompt** (Optional): Starts the conversation automatically
      - Without a prompt, the agent waits for user input
      - Useful for specific, immediate tasks
      - Required if no instructions are provided

   - **Activities**: Example tasks that appear as clickable bubbles
      - Help users understand what the recipe can do
      - Make it easy to get started

## What's Included

A recipe captures:

- AI instructions (goal/purpose)  
- Suggested activities (examples for the user to click)  
- Enabled extensions and their configurations  
- Project folder or file context  
- Initial setup (but not full conversation history)
- The model and provider to use when running the recipe (optional)


To protect your privacy and system integrity, Goose excludes:

- Global and local memory  
- API keys and personal credentials  
- System-level Goose settings  


This means others may need to supply their own credentials or memory context if the recipe depends on those elements.
